Every morning, Farmer John wakes up and walks across the farm from his house to the barn. The farm is a collection of N fields (1 <= N <= 250) connected by M bidirectional pathways (1 <= M <= 25 000), each with an associated length. Farmer John's house is in field 1, and the barn is in field N. No pair of fields is joined by multiple redundant pathways, and it is possible to travel between any pair of fields in the farm by walking along an appropriate sequence of pathways. When traveling from one field to another, Farmer John always selects a route consisting of a sequence of pathways having minimum total length.

Farmer John's cows, up to no good as always, have decided to interfere with his morning routine. They plan to build a pile of hay bales on exactly one of the M pathways on the farm, doubling its length. The cows wish to select a pathway to block so that they maximize the increase in Farmer John's distance from the house to the barn. Please help the cows determine by how much they can lengthen Farmer John's route.
INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Two space-separated integers, N and M.

* Lines 2..M+1: Line i+1 describes the ith bidirectional pathway in terms of three space-separated integers: A_i B_i L_i, where A_i and B_i are indices in the range 1..N indicating the fields joined by the pathway, and L_i is the length of the pathway (in the range 1...1 000 000).
OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The maximum possible increase in the total length of Farmer John's shortest route made possible by doubling the length of a single pathway.
EXAMPLE

sample input:
5 7
2 1 5
1 3 1
3 2 8
3 5 7
3 4 3
2 4 7
4 5 2
sample output:
2
SOLUTION NOTES:

Currently, the shortest path from the house (field 1) to the barn (field 5) is 1-3-4-5 of total length 6.

If the cows double the length of the pathway from field 3 to field 4 (increasing its length from 3 to 6), then Farmer John's shortest route is now 1-3-5 of total length 8 and larger by two than the previous shortest route length.
